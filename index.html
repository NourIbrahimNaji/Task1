<p>  Good afternoon.
    My name is Nour Naji, a recent graduate in Computer Systems Engineering from Birzeit University with a GPA of 84.
     During my studies, I gained strong programming skills in languages like Java, C, Python, and frameworks such as ASP.NET and 
     Android development. I've also worked on various projects that enhanced my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.</p>

<p>In my practical training, I worked with several key technologies like EFCore, the Repository pattern, Mapster, .NET Core API,
     JWT Authentication, ML.NET, BLAZOR for the user interface, and gRPC. I developed individual applications using these tools and 
     also contributed to a larger project that combined all these technologies into one integrated solution.
</p>   

<p>My graduation project `Al Assisted Physical Therapy using Pose Detection focuses on helping patients perform physical therapy exercises at
     home using a technological solution We implemented pose estimation techniques to generate a skeletal representation of
      body movements and used machine learning, specifically a Random Forest classifier, to recognize and categorize exercises. 
      We also used Body Part Embeddings (BPE) to evaluate exercise quality through cosine similarity. This system provides patients
       with real-time feedback and guidance, helping them recover more effectively from joint injuries."</p>
